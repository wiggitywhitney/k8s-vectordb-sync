Resource Sync Controller is now complete. Final work added e2e pipeline tests using a mock HTTP server in Kind (verifies upsert/delete payloads), a full pipeline integration script that orchestrates controller + cluster-whisperer + ChromaDB, and comprehensive README documentation. The controller watches Kubernetes resources via dynamic informers, debounces/batches changes, and POSTs metadata to cluster-whisperer's REST API. Together they keep cluster-whisperer's vector search tool current with what's running in the cluster.
