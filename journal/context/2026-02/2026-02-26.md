PRD #5 M4 complete: Full-stack validation of CRD change detection pipeline. Created test/fullstack/validate.sh that orchestrates operator install → CRD detection → capability inference → ChromaDB verification. Validated with CloudNativePG (10 CRDs), Redis Operator (4 CRDs), MongoDB Community (1 CRD) — all produced capabilities with LLM-inferred descriptions in ChromaDB. Uninstall verification confirmed immediate capability removal. Key discovery: cluster-whisperer's serve command wasn't wiring the capabilities route deps — fixed by adding discoverResources/inferCapabilities/storeCapabilities to createApp() call in src/index.ts (separate repo change). The full pipeline works: controller detects CRDs → batches with debounce → POSTs to cluster-whisperer → async LLM inference → stored in ChromaDB with confidence scores.
